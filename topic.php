		<h2>Cloud Computing History</h2>
		<!-- setting a function for this aside so that when a mouse cursor is placed it floats to right  -->
			<p> The cloud was initially intended to represent the void between the end user and the supplier. </p>   
				<ol> <!-- Creating an ordered list -->
				<li>Late 1990s:</li> 
					<p>Cloud computing is the next "computer paradigm, where the limitations of computing will be dictated by economic reasoning, rather than technological restrictions alone," according to Professor Ramnath Chellapa of Emory University in 1997 (Foote, 2021).</p>
					<p> In 1999, Salesforce sprang to prominence as a successful use of cloud computing. They utilised it to develop the concept of delivering software to people through the Internet (Foote, 2021). </p>
				<li>2000s:
				<ul>
				<li>2000-2010:</li>
				   <p>Amazon debuted its web-based shopping services in 2002. It was the first significant company to see operating at just 10% of capacity—a practise that was widespread at the time—as a challenge (Foote, 2021).  . </p> <p>
					Amazon introduced Amazon Web Services in 2006, which provides online services to other websites or customers. Amazon Mechanical Turk, one of Amazon Web Services' websites, offers a range of cloud-based services, including storage, processing, and "human intelligence" (Foote, 2021).   </p> <p>
					In 2008, Eucalyptus provided the first AWS API-compatible platform for delivering private clouds. The first open-source software for setting up private and hybrid clouds was made available the same year by NASA's OpenNebula project (Foote, 2021).  </p> 

				    
				<li>2010-2021:</li>
				   <p>Private clouds had been established by organisations like AWS, Microsoft, and OpenStack in 2010, and they were largely functioning. (OpenStack also made a widely used, open-sourced, free DIY cloud platform available to the general public in 2010) (Foote, 2021). </p> <p>
					2011 saw the introduction of the hybrid cloud concept. The flexibility to move workloads back and forth between a private and public cloud is required, as is a decent level of interoperability between the two clouds (Foote, 2021). </p> <p>
					In support of Smarter Planet, IBM unveiled the IBM SmartCloud architecture in 2011. (a cultural thinking project). Then Apple introduced the ICloud, which aims to store more private data (photos, music, videos, etc.) (Foote, 2021). </p> <p>
					The Oracle Cloud, which offers IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SAAS, was released by Oracle in 2012. (Software-as-a-Service) (Foote, 2021). </p> <p>
					In 2012, CloudBolt was established. This business is recognised for creating a hybrid cloud management platform that assisted businesses in creating, deploying, and managing both private and public clouds. They fixed the issues with public and private cloud compatibility (Foote, 2021). </p> <p>
					By 2014, cloud computing had established its fundamental components and security had grown to be a top priority (Foote, 2021). </p> 

				 </ul>
				</li>
				<li>2022:</li>
					<p>Organizations are adopting the following trends in cloud computing at an ever-increasing rate:
					<ul>
						<li>Increasing eCommerce</li>
						<li>Electronic transformation</li>
						<li>Containers</li>
						<li>Cloud-based workstations</li>
						<li>Open-source cloud</li>
						<li>Automating the cloud</li>
						<li>Edge processing</li>
						<li>Cloud optimized regulatory compliance</li>
						<li>Artificial intelligence</li>

				<p >According to technology researcher IDC, cloud infrastructure investment will have increased 8.3% from 2020 to $71.8 billion for the entire year of 2021, while non-cloud infrastructure is predicted to have expanded just 1.9% to $58.4 billion(Ranger, 2022). </p>
				<p>

					According to tech researcher Gartner, by 2025, up from 41% in 2022, up to 50% of investment in the application software, infrastructure software, business process services, and system infrastructure industries would have moved to the cloud (Ranger, 2022). </p>

				<h2> Responsible Groups </h2>
					<p>An approach for defining the responsibilities that cloud service users and cloud service providers play in cloud security is the shared responsibility model. According to the shared responsibility paradigm, consumers and service providers are each accountable for maintaining the security of the cloud. To achieve cloud security goals, clients and cloud service providers must collaborate (Harvey, 2018). </p><p>

					Let's imagine the range of security requirements to comprehend the shared responsibility paradigm. Customers of cloud services add up all applicable legal, contractual, and industry standards (such as GDPR, PCI DSS, and contracts) and the result represents all their organization's unique security requirements. These security criteria will aid in ensuring that data is available, private, and has integrity (Harvey, 2018). </p>

				<h2>Growth/Future</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>AI: The most recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) include innovative algorithms, AI training, generative machine learning, language modelling, accuracy improvement, and more. The infrastructure required to offer these services efficiently and effectively depends on cloud computing (Bhatti, 2022).</li><li>
							Automation: Automation is the engine behind efficiency improvements and cloud computing. Organizations may easily automate a variety of internal tasks when their data and workloads are centrally located in a secure cloud environment, including maintenance updates, automatic scaling up and down depending on demand criteria, and turning VMs on and off as necessary (Bhatti, 2022).</li><li>
							Cloud security: Services provided via the cloud are more resistant to security risks. They are first continuously patched and updated. Second, they make use of increasingly advanced and widespread security measures. In a same vein, they maintain pace with modern security designs, which is far more difficult and expensive to achieve when hosting your own hardware and software on premises (Bhatti, 2022).</li>
