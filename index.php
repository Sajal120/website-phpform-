		  <p class="bl"> Companies can access everything from programmes to storage from a cloud service provider, renting access to them rather than having their own computing equipment or data centres. Utilizing cloud computing services allows businesses to bypass the upfront costs and complexity of purchasing and maintaining their own IT infrastructure in favour of paying only for the services they use (Ranger, 2022). 

 

					By offering the same services to a wide range of consumers, cloud computing service companies may gain enormous economies of scale. </p>

					Cloud computing as a term has been around since the early 2000s, but the concept of computing as a service has been around for much, much longer â€“ as far back as the 1960s, when computer bureaux would allow companies to rent time on a mainframe rather than having to buy one themselves (Ranger, 2022).
